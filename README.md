# 🎵 Digital Signal Processing Activities

This repository contains my laboratory activities for **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** 📈, implemented and simulated using **Microsoft Excel**.  
These exercises explore fundamental DSP concepts such as signals, harmonics, and sampling, visualized and computed through spreadsheet techniques.

## 📂 Activities

### 🔷 Domain Expression of Sampling
Explores the time and frequency domain representation of a sampled signal.  
📊 *Understand how signals are represented in different domains and how sampling affects them.*

---

### 🎶 Harmonics of Frequencies
Demonstrates how harmonics contribute to the composition of complex signals.  
🎻 *Visualize the addition of harmonic frequencies to form periodic waveforms.*

---

### 📈 Unit Step - Ramp - Exponential Signal
Simulates basic signal types:  
- Unit step
- Ramp
- Exponential  
📐 *Foundation for building and analyzing more complex signals.*
